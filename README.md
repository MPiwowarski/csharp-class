## About "C# Basics" Course

1. We will learn about C# basics from scratch, which allows you to understand how programs work and give you knowledge on how to build your own console applications.

2. During the meetings I will demo and discuss specific things about .NET CORE platform and C#. You will be asked to replicate stuff that I demoed and occasionally you will have to resolve simple tasks that I provide you.

3. After each class I will give you some homework. It's essential to do homework on your own as it will make you closer to feeling and being an individual software developer.
- I will groom and explain homework from previous lesson at the very beginning of next class.

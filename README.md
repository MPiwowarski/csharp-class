## About "C# Basics" Course

1. We will learn C# basics from scratch, which will give you an understanding of how programs work and knowledge of how to build your own console applications.

2. During the meetings, I will demonstrate and discuss specific topics related to the .NET CORE platform and C#. You will be asked to replicate what I demo, and occasionally, you will have to complete simple tasks I provide.

3. After each class, you will receive homework. It's essential to complete the homework on your own as it will help you feel closer to becoming an individual software developer. I will review and explain the previous lesson's homework at the start of the next class.
